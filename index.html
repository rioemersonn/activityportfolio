    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I’m 19 years old and I have a strong curiosity for learning and discovering new things. I enjoy exploring a wide range of topics, from technology, programming, and database design to practical everyday knowledge and problem-solving. I’m someone who likes to understand how things work, whether it’s a complex system, a piece of software, or even day-to-day challenges, and I enjoy finding creative and effective solutions.
I’m also self-aware and reflective, always looking for ways to grow and improve myself. I value knowledge and skills that I can apply in real life, and I like taking on challenges that push me to think critically and adapt. I’m open to new experiences, eager to learn from others, and motivated to keep improving both personally and professionally.</p><hr>
